Types of variables:

There are 3 types of variables: Local, instance and static.

1.Local Variables:
are the variables which are created or declared inside a block of code like "if else conditions", "loops",
"switch statements", "methods" are block of code.
Upside:

They occupy the memory for the shortest period of time. As soon as java is done executing that block of code
they are removed from the memory.

Downside:

They can only be accessed within the block of code they are created


Instance variables:
are the variables which are created outside of the blocks( is else, switch, loops, methods etc) of code but
inside a class.

Upside:

They can be accessed anywhere within that class

Downside:

They are created when an object of the class is created and they will stay in the memory as long as that object
is in the memory, doesnt matte if you use it or not.



2.Static variables:

are created inside the class, but outside of a block of code with a static keyword.

Upside:
They are universal when it comes to scope and accessibility. We dont even need to create the object of that class
in which they are created we can simply write the name of the class and can access it.

Downside:
Static variables occupy the memory for longest at all.
They are created even though you don't create any object of the class.

Uses of types of local variables:


Local:
Whenever we are solving any problem many times we need local variables to temporally store data.In all of those
cases you should be going with local variables.
