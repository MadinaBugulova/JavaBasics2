Inheritance:

allows one class to have all the properties and methods class except private members and constructors.
We use extends keyword.
Why should we learn about inheritance?
1. Faster development
2. Saves memory


Rules:

1. Private members (fields and methods) are not accessible in child classes
2. Constructors are also no available for child classes directly

Types of inheritance:
single - only one parent and one child ( not very common)
hierarchical - one parent, multiple child
multilevel - happens when a class C inherits from B and B inherits from A
hybrid
multiple( it is not supported by java) - multiple parent classes and one child class

What is Diamond problem in OOP?

The ambiguity that arises when two classes B and C inherit from A, and a further class D inherits from both B and C,
so that if there is a method in A that B and/or C has overridden, and D does not override it,
it is unclear which version of the method D should inherit.
