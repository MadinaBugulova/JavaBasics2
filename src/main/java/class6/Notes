Operators:
Operators are symbols which perform an operation on data. There are many different types of operators in Java,
for example:

Arithmetic operators-
These operators help us perform simple mathematical operations like addition(+), subtraction (-),
multiplication ( * ), division ( / ), modulus- ostatok  ( % )

Shorthand Operators-
They help us perform Mathematical Operations but using a little shorter syntax:
add and update the variable ( += int a=10 a+=20, a=30 )
subtract and update the variable (-= a=10 a-=20 a=-10)
multiply and update the variable (*= a=10 a*=20 a=200)
divide and update the variable (/= a=10 a/=20 a=0)
modulus and update the variable (%= a=10 a%=20 a=10)

Relational Operators-
These operators help us compare things
== checks if 2 objetcs are equal
!= check if 2 objects are not equal
> greater than
< less than
>= greater than equal
<= less tha equal

Logical Operators-
They help us combine mulpitle boolean conditions

! Not
|| Or
&& And

Increment?Decrement operators

++ this will help us increase the value of a variable by one
-- this will help us decrease the value of a variable by one

Note:
While loop checks the condition first then executes the code. Do while on the other hand executes the code first
ans then checks the condition.
