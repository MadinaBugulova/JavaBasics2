Maps:

are dataStructures which are stores key value pairs.
There are many dif types of maps in java but we will be discussing:
 -HashMap
 -LinkedHashMap
 -TreeMap
 -HashTable

 Why we should learn about Maps?

 All the other datastructures that we have learnt can only store one value at a time and they are indexed based.
 Maps allow us to store key value pairs which makes the better choice because we know what we are storing.

Maps are not part of the collections framework. Map is the name of the interface and HashMap,LinkedHashMap,TreeMap,
HashTable are the classes that implement this interface.

Syntax of Maps:
NameofTheClass<DataTypeOfKey,DataTypeofValue> variable name= new NameofTheClass<>();
ArrayList<String> names= new ArrayList<>();
HashMap<String,Double> names=new HashMap<>();
