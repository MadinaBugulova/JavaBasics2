Abstraction:
is the process of hiding implementation details and showing only the functionality to the end user.
We use the abstract keyword with methods to avoid the implementation details.
Why should we use abstraction?
1. flexibility ( if we dont know or want to provide the implementation we can skip it)
2.

Rules:
1. we cannot create the objects of the abstract classes
2. all the child classes must provide the implementation to the abstract methods which are coming from parent or
mark the child class also abstract
3. an abstract class can have full body methods as well as abstract method
4.we can have instance
