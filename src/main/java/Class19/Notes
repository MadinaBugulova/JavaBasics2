Method Overloading ( famous interview question):

happens when multiple methods with same name but with different parameters.
1. different number of parameters for example min (2,3) min (4,5,6)
2. different datatype of methods print ("Java") print (12);
3. different sequence/order of parameters print ( "Java",12) print (12,"Java")
Benefits of overloading method:
1. cleaner code
2. we dont need to come up with dif method names


Method Overriding:
it happens when same name method is present is parent as well as child class.






another interview question:

add(int num1, double num2) are called signature ( as a
parameters). Signature is the name of the method+ parameters

public void add(double num1, int num2) - header ( signature+return type+
access modifier)
