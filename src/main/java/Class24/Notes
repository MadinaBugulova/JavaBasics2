Collections Framework:
Its a collection of class and interfaces which help us build dynamic programs which are capable of handling
large amounts of data.

Why should we learn about collections framework?

Arrays are not good and we need something that is dynamic and more flexible. For example:

1. They are fixed in size
2. No ready made methods we have to create our own


Arraylist:

better version of Arrays.It is also index based. Its dynamic we dont need to provide the size before hand and it
contains a lot of methods to manipulate the data inside it.

Syntax:

For Arrays we used this syntax:

DataType[] nameForArray=new DataType [Size]
String [] arr= new String [5];
ArrayList<DataType> nameForArrayList=new ArrayList<>();
ArrayList<String> arrayList=new ArrayList<>();

Methods From ArrayList:
Size()=> No Of Elements.
add(Element)=> adds new element to the arrayList
get( Index) => returns to the element on specified index
remove (Index)=> removes the element on the specified index
remove (Element) => removes the element from the arrayList
indexOf(element)=>returns the index of passed element
contains(element)=>returns true if element is present otherwise false
