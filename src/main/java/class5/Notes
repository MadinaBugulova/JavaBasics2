Logical Operators:
    Logical Operators help combine muptiple conditions on the same line in if statements.  There are 3 types of logical
    operators NOT (!) OR (||) AND (&&).
 NOT (!):
true=>false
false=>false
NOT works only with Boolean
Why should we use NOT operator:
1. It can help us simplify the logic in some of the cases
2. Code readability will in increase

 OR (||):
Logical OR operator will help us combine multiple conditions in such a way that as soon as one condition gets true
the whole condition will be evaluated to true.

if one of the conditions is true with || operator the output will be true
true||false||true=>true
false||false||false=>false

 AND (&&)
Logical and Operator will help us combine the conditions in such a way that it will only give us true
if all the conditions are true.

true && false && true=>false
true && true && true=>true
