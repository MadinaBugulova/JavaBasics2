Super Keyword:
is used to access things from the parent class.
We can access instance variables, methods and constructors.
Why should we learn about super:

-without super () we can't call the constructor from the parent class and we might have to repeat that
constructor in all of the class and if someone decrease the fields private we will not be able to even access
the fields in child classes
-we can use super to call the fields from the parent class if we have same name fields in the child class

Rules:
-when we use super () we must call at least 1 constructor from the parent class because java needs at least
one constructor from parent as it always first creates the object of the parent class when we create the object
of the child class
-when we have same name field as local instance and in the parent class as well.Java prefers the local first then
the instance of the same class then the instance of the parent class. However if we directly went to access
the field from the parent we can use super keyword.
