String Class


String Class is designed to store symbols (letters(A,d,C), numbers (10,25),
special characters ( #,$,%)) in the form of a group. There are many methods already written by java
developers that we can just use. This is the most widely used class  in java.
For example:
length()
startsWith()
endsWith()
contains() it searches for the provided screen

Why we should learn about this class:
1. Very important for coding questions
2. MOst widely used class in all java
3. Most of the information in real life is present in the form of Strings.


Method Chaining:
when multiple methods are being called on the same line its called method chaining.
String class supports method changing . for method changing to work previous method must return
to the expected datatype to the next method.



For interviews:

1. If else
2. Loops
3. Arrays
4. Strings

Length is not starting from 0
Index starts from 1
so when we adding str.length it is counting from 1
when we need to count all indexes it is going to start counting from 0
