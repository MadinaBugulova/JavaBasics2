SuperKeyword:

refers to the parent class. We can use super keyword to access variables, methods and constructors from parent class.

Why should we use super keyword?

1. To specifically call something from the parent class,like a variable or method
2. We can use super() to call the constructor from the parent

MethodOverloading:

1. When we have same method with dif parameters its called overloading.Parameters can be dif in 3 ways:
- we can change the count of the parameters. We can overload methods as well as constructors
- we can also change the datatype of parameters if number of parameters are same
- we can change the sequence if datatype and number  of parameters are same


Why?

-cleaner code, we dont have to come up with dif method names
-reuse: same name can be reused many times


Interview Question:

Can we overload a private method? yes
Can we overload a static method? yes
Can we overload the main method? yes
Can we overload a method by changing its return type?

Method Overriding:

when same method is present in parent as well as child class.Its called overriding
