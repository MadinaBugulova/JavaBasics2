OOP- object oriented programming
Its simply a way of writing code, some rules that we follow. There are other ways as well like functional, programming,
procedural programming. There are 4 main pillars of OOP:
1.inheritance-it will help u to reuse the code of a different class
2.polymorphism-many funds( the code will become dynamic), it will be able to act differently
3.abstraction-when we dont have a complete knowledge about something, we apply partial code
4.encapsulation-to protect the data
Why should we learn OOP:
1. code re-usability
2. its easier to write large amounts of code
3. sharing code with others become easier
4. security of the code is increased
5. changing code become easier
Object:
Every physical thing is an object ( something we can touch and see ). We can easily represent these objects
inside our computers by telling a computer how an object looks like and how it behaves.

Class:
A class is like a design/map/blueprint that we use to create objects.

String class:
Is used to store and manipulate text based data. Most of the information inside computers is processed in this form.
String is most widely used class in all java.
Creating objects from String class.
