nested loops

A nested loop is a loop inside another loop. Nested loops are used to solve complex problems in which we
have nested data or we need to perform nested iterations. We can rest a for loop inside a while loop;
or for loop inside another for loop.

Why nested loops:
A tester we will be needing them to read excel data.
We will be needing them to go thru multiple pages and from each page we might want to go thru multiple items.

Syntax:

for ( int i=0; i<10; i++){
for  (int j=0; J<10; j++)

}
}
