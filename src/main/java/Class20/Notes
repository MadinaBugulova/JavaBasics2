MethodOverriding:
When we have exact same methods in parent and child class we call it method overriding.
This method gives us a lot of flexibility , for example, if we dont like a method from the parent class
we can override it/change.

Syntax:

class Parent {

void eat (){
sout "Fish"
}
}
class Child extend Parent {

void eat (){
sout "Chicken"
}
}
